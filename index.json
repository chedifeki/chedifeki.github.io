We are living through a time when the tools meant to assist thinking are starting to think back.\nAI has blurred the line between creation and curation, making it both easier and harder to produce meaningful work.\nEasier, because we can now explore ideas faster than ever.\nHarder, because depth and authenticity require resisting the pull of convenience.\nStarting this blog is my way of slowing down within that acceleration.\nIt’s a place to reflect in public, to document how I learn, design, build, and occasionally fail — not as an authority, but as a participant in an ongoing conversation about how humans create meaning in a world increasingly co-authored by machines.\nIn short, I’m here to think aloud with intention — to map understanding, not to claim it.\nTools I\u0026rsquo;m Using Good tools don’t make the work easier — they make the thinking clearer.\nThis blog is built using a small but cohesive toolchain that mirrors how I work across disciplines:\nObsidian — my personal knowledge base. It’s where I write, collect notes, and connect ideas through backlinks and graph views. Hugo — the static site generator powering this blog. Fast, clean, and structured, it aligns with my preference for modular design. Chirpy Theme — minimal, responsive, and typography-focused. It keeps the focus on content, not decoration. GitHub Pages — simple, free hosting. It closes the loop between local iteration and public sharing. The stack reflects a broader principle: own your tools, understand your process, and make your infrastructure transparent.\nPhilosophy of This Blog This isn’t a blog in the traditional sense — it’s a public lab notebook.\nYou won’t find polished tutorials or definitive takes here.\nInstead, expect drafts, prototypes, systems maps, and conceptual explorations across a few recurring themes:\nLearning in Public — sharing not the answers, but the questions. Systems Thinking — connecting software design, creativity, and human behavior. Creative Process — how music, writing, and coding intersect in practice. Knowledge Architecture — how we structure, store, and evolve ideas over time. I believe the internet needs more processes and fewer personas.\nBy documenting the journey — the missteps, iterations, and half-formed insights — I hope to leave behind not a brand, but a trail of understanding.\nIf anything here sparks thought, disagreement, or collaboration, then this experiment has already served its purpose.\n","permalink":"https://chedifeki.github.io/post/on-starting-this-blog/","tags":["learning","writing","technology","reflection"],"title":"On Starting This Blog"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","permalink":"https://chedifeki.github.io/archives/","tags":null,"title":"Archives"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","permalink":"https://chedifeki.github.io/categories/","tags":null,"title":"Categories"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","permalink":"https://chedifeki.github.io/tags/","tags":null,"title":"Tags"}]
